# POLITICAL SITE 💼

Everyone loves good political humor and often makes fun of politicians and judges. This site will be the place where you (and others, of course) can post a mocking hockey about a politician's latest oversight or activities. It will be especially relevant in the pre-election season.

Site type: blog. ✏

Key features:

- A blog interface with a series of hokku that are easy to browse. 🖼
- Funny illustrations of candidates with their hokku, easy to read. 🎨
- "Infinite" scrolling or new page for every 20-50 hokku. 🎞
- Using a Google Form so that others can submit their own image or hokku too. 🎫
